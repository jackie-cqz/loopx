### Problem

The original LoopX manager was a restricted planning conversation. It could read scoped,
structured Goal context but could not use the host's filesystem, shell, Git, web access, or
configured connectors. That is a safe installation default, but it also turns ordinary work
already authorized by the owner into delegation, waiting, or manual context transfer.

Removing a prompt sentence is insufficient. The host sandbox, prompt, managed workspace
instructions, persistent configuration, and Session readback must describe the same effective
mode; otherwise the UI can claim an enabled profile while an old upstream thread remains
read-only.

### Contract

`manager_runtime_profile_v0` is an explicit, persistent machine-level grant:

- `restricted` is the default. The manager keeps scoped LoopX reads and the Codex sandbox is
  `read-only`.
- `trusted_owner` lets the Codex manager use normal host filesystem, shell, Git, web, and
  configured-connector tools. Its Codex sandbox is `danger-full-access`.
- `trusted_owner` is not ambient authority. The current request and existing standing grants
  still bound the work. Protected merge, release, deploy, delete, and payment operations retain
  their typed contracts. Provider permission, audience, and durable LoopX state ownership do
  not change.
- Codex is currently the only endpoint that enforces `trusted_owner`. Other endpoints fail with
  an actionable typed error instead of pretending to provide the selected profile.
- `trusted_owner` currently applies only to the private owner-manager conversation. An external
  audience, including a Lark group, is a separate trust boundary and resolves the same machine
  choice to `restricted` until an existing audience/resource grant can be verified.

Configuration reuses the existing capability workbench and its
`preview -> apply -> readback` transaction. There is no second configuration source. Missing
configuration defaults to `restricted`; invalid configuration also falls back safely and
projects `configuration_invalid` plus a repair action.

### Session consistency

Each manager Session records the profile, sandbox, standing grant, tool classes, configuration
revision, and status used to start its upstream thread. A change to the effective manager
namespace closes the old upstream thread and starts a new one with visible history, preventing
stale sandbox or prompt state. Changes to unrelated machine capabilities do not rotate a healthy
manager. A healthy legacy Session already equivalent to the restricted default is backfilled
without an unnecessary restart.

Dashboard shows both machine configuration and current Session readback. CLI/managed Turn,
Dashboard, and Lark all use the same manager runtime controller. Lark remains an entry point and
projection of that Session; it does not own a separate profile or permission state, but an external
audience currently degrades visibly to `restricted`. Future Lark host-tool access must reuse an
existing audience/resource authority instead of adding a manager-specific ACL here.

This slice implements only the private-owner M1 journey in
[capable-manager-semantic-handoff-v0](capable-manager-semantic-handoff-v0.md), targeting A1–A3/A12.
It does not implement the M2 collaboration request, the M3 outbox, or treat manager Session fields
as work, request, or delivery authority.

### Qualification checkpoint (2026-10-02)

The private-owner M1 profile is qualified against a real Codex app-server: default
restriction, explicit configuration readback, an authorized synthetic file write,
profile downgrade, external-audience restriction, invalid configuration fallback,
and restart with retained Session history. A trusted profile now requires matching
host sandbox and approval-policy readback; missing or mismatched policy fails closed.
Equivalent effective profiles update configuration metadata without rotating a thread.

Codex may not persist a thread until its first Turn. A private dispatch marker lets
LoopX recreate only a thread with no attempted Turn, preserving visible history.
Once dispatch is attempted, recovery retains the exact upstream binding and never
replays the Turn. Owned Windows app-server process trees close with the adapter.
Dashboard refreshes actual Session readback without replacing it with stale machine
configuration. Packaged desktop/mobile readback and focused negative tests pass.

Run the opt-in real-host qualification from the source checkout with
`uv run --extra test python examples/manager-runtime-profile-live-smoke.py --execute-real-host --codex-bin codex`.
It uses model quota and disposable synthetic Sessions; it does not resume user Sessions.
Run packaged UI qualification with `LOOPX_PERSONAL_WORKSPACE_SCENARIO=manager-runtime-readback node examples/personal-workspace-browser-smoke.mjs --packaged`.
Live Lark transport, non-Codex host qualification, M2/M3, and remote collaboration
remain untested here. R2's broader continued-execution acceptance remains open;
see the [roadmap](loopx-overall-roadmap-v0.md).

### Acceptance

1. A default installation starts `restricted` with no implicit grant.
2. Machine configuration preview/apply/readback persists `trusted_owner`.
3. A new Codex manager thread sends `danger-full-access` to app-server, and its Turn prompt and
   managed `AGENTS.md` no longer contain the read-only restriction.
4. A profile change rotates the upstream thread while preserving the LoopX Session and visible
   history.
5. An unrelated machine-configuration change does not rotate the thread.
6. A non-Codex endpoint fails closed for `trusted_owner` and recommends selecting Codex or
   restoring `restricted`.
7. Desktop and mobile Dashboard show the effective profile; invalid configuration shows its
   fallback state.
8. An external audience without an existing scoped grant remains `read-only` and exposes the
   effective downgrade accurately.
